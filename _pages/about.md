I am a third year Ph.D. student in Economics at IRES/[LIDAM](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam), UCLouvain and [Department of Economics, UGent](https://www.ugent.be/eb/economics/en/research/laboureconwelfpg), under the supervision of [Muriel Dejemeppe](https://perso.uclouvain.be/muriel.dejemeppe/) and [Bart Cockx](https://sites.google.com/site/bartcockxsite/).
<br />

Research interests: **micro-econometrics** and **labor economics**. <br />


I am currently evaluating the impact of **Short-time work (STW) policies** in Belgium during the Great Recession and COVID-19 period within the program BRAIN-be 2.0 (2020-2025) funded by the Belgian Federal Administration Science Policy [(BELSPO)](https://www.belspo.be/).

<br />
I will be visiting the Department of Economics at Sciences Po University from January to March 2024. Let me know if you are around!
