Welcome to my website. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from UCLouvain ([IRES/LIDAM](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam)) and Ghent University ([Department of Economics](https://www.ugent.be/eb/economics/en/research/laboureconwelfpg)), where I was jointly supervised by [Muriel Dejemeppe](https://perso.uclouvain.be/muriel.dejemeppe/) and [Bart Cockx](https://sites.google.com/site/bartcockxsite/).
<br />

My research interests include **micro-econometrics** and **labor economics**. <br />

My doctoral thesis evaluated the impact of Short-Time Work (STW) policies in Belgium during the Great Recession and the COVID-19 crisis, as part of the BRAIN-be 2.0 (2020–2025) program funded by the [Belgian Federal Administration Science Policy (BELSPO)](https://www.belspo.be/).<br />

In spring 2024, I was a visiting researcher at the Department of Economics at Sciences Po University, hosted by Professor Pierre Cahuc.

I am currently working as a researcher at UCLouvain until February 2026.
