- title: "Short-time work and its effect on employment and firm survival: evidence from the Great Recession in Belgium"
  coauthors: "Bart Cockx"
  abstract: > 
  Short-time work is a public insurance program that allows employers to temporarily reduce employees working hours without terminating the employee-employer relationship, while providing a subsidy that partially compensates employees for the loss of income. During the global financial crisis, many European countries reintroduced or modified STW schemes, with Belgium being no exception and having the highest uptake in Europe. Given the program's significant public expenditure implications, it is crucial to investigate its short- and medium-run effects on employment and firm survival. We use detailed administrative data and employ an instrumental variable first difference estimator that exploits exogeneous variation using an institutional feature of the Belgian scheme. Our findings are consistent with previous evidence, indicating that STW is effective in preserving jobs in the short run but results in a reduction in total hours per firm, suggesting the possibility of deadweight losses at recession peaks. 

- title: "Hiring subsidies and temporary work agencies" 
    coauthors: "Sam Desiere"
    abstract: > 
    This paper evaluates a hiring subsidy for lower-educated youth in Flanders, Belgium. In contrast to most studies, we do not find positive employment effects of the hiring subsidy on eligible job seekers. We offer a novel explanation for this null finding. We first document that roughly 40% of the subsidised jobs were temporary work agency jobs. We then show that these agencies did not respond to the policy and employed fewer eligible individuals after the reform. Our findings highlight the role of temporary work agencies in shaping the effectiveness of policies targeted at disadvantaged groups.

- title: "Firm outcomes adjustment in response to changes in the corporate income tax rate in Developing Countries: Evidence from Ecuador 2013 - 2019" 
    coauthors: "William ParientÃ© (supervisor of Master Thesis)"
    abstract: > 
    The low tax capacity is an important issue in many developing and emerging countries. Most governments have tackled this issue by implementing fiscal reforms that comprise changes in tax rates, improvements in administrative enforcement or even both at the same time. I use a quasi experimental setting created as a result of a fiscal reform in Ecuador in late 2014. Using a panel of administrative data from firms financial statements during the period 2013-2018, I exploit the variation created by the reform that consisted in an increase from 22% to 25% - in 2015 - and to 28% - in 2018 - on the statutory corporate income tax rate. Three types of responses are studied: 1) corporate size responses, 2) financing responses, 3) profit shifting responses and 4) changes in ownership structure after the reform. Even though there is a large literature that has been built around firms behavior to changes in corporate tax rates in developed countries, there is ambiguos and scarced evidence about the responses of firms to fiscal reforms in developing and emerging countries.
