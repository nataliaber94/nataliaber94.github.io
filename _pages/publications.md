**"Short-time work and its effect on employment and firm survival: evidence from the Great Recession in Belgium"**
<i><font size="-0.5"> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bartcockxsite/">Bart Cockx</a> and <a href="https://www.nbb.be/nl/blog/author/gert-bijnens?language=de">Gert Bijnens</a>. </font></i>[<font size="-0.5"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tKwA_jd9HXwmhWDlDGVVOg5511Hzry_8/view?usp=sharing">Abstract</a></font>]

<p style="text-align: justify"> <font size="-1"> <strong> Abstract: </strong> This paper examines the effectiveness of Short-time work (STW) programs during the Great Recession in Belgium, the country with the highest uptake in Europe. While earlier studies have evaluated similar programs in other European countries during the same period, conclusions have varied based on the characteristics of treated firms and the persistence of economic shocks. Our study contributes to understanding the determinants of these findings. Leveraging novel
administrative micro-aggregated data on program usage and exploiting exogenous variations in STW take-up through an institutional feature, we find, in line with existing literature, that STW effectively preserved jobs and increased working hours, at least one year after the crisis onset in Belgium. This positive impact aligns with the observed positive effect on firm survival also one year after the initial aggregate shock. Despite the persistent positive effect on employment in subsequent periods, this is not statistically significant for the average firm. Future analyses aim to identify the firms that benefited the most from the policy and assess the persistence of these effects over time.</font>

**"Hiring subsidies and temporary work agencies"**
  
<i><font size="-0.5"> with <a href="https://www.iza.org/person/30997/sam-desiere">Sam Desiere</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/giuliatarullo/home-page">Giulia Tarullo</a>. </font></i>[<font size="-0.5"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oEdmgjWlwJvhd7HU1Kda_5RZllAgdgOp/view?usp=sharing">Abstract</a></font>]

<p style="text-align: justify"> <font size="-1"> <strong> Abstract: </strong> This paper evaluates a hiring subsidy for lower-educated youth in Flanders (Belgium) that reduced labour costs by 10% to 15% for a period of two years. The hiring subsidy did not improve the job finding rate of eligible job seekers. We offer a novel explanation for this null finding. We first document that temporary work agencies obtained about 25% to 34% of the subsidies, and hired almost 40% of the subsidised job seekers. We then show that agencies did not respond to the policy by increasing the wages of subsidised workers. Remarkably, despite a 2.8% labour cost reduction, agencies employed 8% fewer eligible individuals after the reform. Our findings highlight the role of temporary work agencies in shaping the effectiveness of active labour market policies targeted at disadvantaged groups.</font>

**"Theory and Empirics of Short-Time Work: A Review"**
  
<i><font size="-0.5"> with <a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/muriel.dejemeppe/">Muriel Dejemeppe</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/giuliatarullo/home-page">Giulia Tarullo</a>. </font></i>[<font size="-0.5"><a href="https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/279649">WP</a></font>]

<p style="text-align: justify"> <font size="-1"> <strong> Abstract: </strong> Following massive take-up rates during the COVID-19 period, short-time work (STW) policies have attracted renewed interest. In this paper, we take stock of this policy instrument and provide a critical review of STW systems in Europe. We focus on the objectives of STW programs and their primary characteristics, as well as the inefficiencies associated with these policies, such as excessive use and slower worker reallocation. Additionally, we take a stroll through the main contributions of STW impact evaluations. Finally, we identify relevant directions for the refinement of the main design features of the scheme, key lessons, and avenues for future research.</font>

**"Taxable Income Elasticities in Developing Countries: Evidence From Ecuador"**
  
<i><font size="-0.5"> with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q-RlvwEAAAAJ&hl=en">José G. Castillo García</a>. </font></i>[<font size="-0.5"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4233450">WP</a></font>]

<p style="text-align: justify"> <font size="-1"> <strong> Abstract: </strong> Tax reforms involve welfare changes that need to be consistently measured. Pivotal parameter in such empirical efforts is the Elasticity of Taxable Income (ETI). This paper contributes to the estimation of the ETI in developing economies. We rely on a research design based on Ecuador's Reformatory Law of Tax Equity of 2007. By using personal income tax administrative records, we show that, on average, the ETI (net-of-MTR) of the aggregated gross income is around -0.23. Also, we find evidence of heterogeneous responses to tax policy shocks through changes in Marginal Tax Rates, conditional on income levels; a one percentage point increase in the MTR leads to an increase of 0.15 percentage points of the aggregated gross income in lower-income taxpayers, while for higher-income taxpayers we report a null effect. Results are robust to different specifications and adjustments proposed due to parallel changes in deduction policies.</font>
