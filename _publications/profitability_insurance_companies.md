abstract: The purpose of this paper is is to identify the main determinants of insurance profitability on life and non-life segments to obtain which variables affect in each market of the Ecuadorian insurance sector. Using a large panel data set with financial information from 2001 to 2017 we estimate the determinants through a panel corrected standard errors regression. We find that net premiums, technical reserves, capital ratio and score efficiency are micro-determinants in the life insurance sector, whereas in the non-life sector, the micro-determinants include also claim levels and liquidity ratios; moreover, we find that HHI is a determinant of profitability only in the life insurance sector. Among the macro determinants set, we find that the interest rate has also a significant impact both in the life and non-life insurance segments.
