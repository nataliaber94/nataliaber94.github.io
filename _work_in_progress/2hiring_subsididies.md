abstract: "This paper evaluates a hiring subsidy for lower-educated youth in Flanders, Belgium. In contrast to most studies, we do not find positive employment effects of the hiring subsidy on eligible job seekers. We offer a novel explanation for this null finding. We first document that roughly 40% of the subsidised jobs were temporary work agency jobs. We then show that these agencies did not respond to the policy and employed fewer eligible individuals after the reform. Our findings highlight the role of temporary work agencies in shaping the effectiveness of policies targeted at disadvantaged groups."
