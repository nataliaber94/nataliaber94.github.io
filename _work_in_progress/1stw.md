abstract: " Short-time work is a public insurance program that allows employers to temporarily reduce employees working hours without terminating the employee-employer relationship, while providing a subsidy that partially compensates employees for the loss of income. During the global financial crisis, many European countries reintroduced or modified STW schemes, with Belgium being no exception and having the highest uptake in Europe. Given the program's significant public expenditure implications, it is crucial to investigate its short- and medium-run effects on employment and firm survival. We use detailed administrative data and employ an instrumental variable first difference estimator that exploits exogeneous variation using an institutional feature of the Belgian scheme. Our findings are consistent with previous evidence, indicating that STW is effective in preserving jobs in the short run but results in a reduction in total hours per firm, suggesting the possibility of deadweight losses at recession peaks."
