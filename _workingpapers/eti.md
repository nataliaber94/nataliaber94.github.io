abstract: "Tax reforms involve welfare changes that need to be consistently measured. Pivotal parameter in such empirical efforts is the Elasticity of Taxable Income (ETI). This paper contributes to the estimation of the ETI in developing economies. We rely on a research design based on Ecuador's Reformatory Law of Tax Equity of 2007. By using personal income tax administrative records, we show that, on average, the ETI (net-of-MTR) of the aggregated gross income is around -0.23. Also, we find evidence of heterogeneous responses to tax policy shocks through changes in Marginal Tax Rates, conditional on income levels; a one percentage point increase in the MTR leads to an increase of 0.15 percentage points of the aggregated gross income in lower-income taxpayers, while for higher-income taxpayers we report a null effect. Results are robust to different specifications and adjustments proposed due to parallel changes in deduction policies."
